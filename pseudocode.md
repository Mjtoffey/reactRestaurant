    Questions
        -How can I use the processes from the debugging mini project to import new data and styling? what would be best based on the live example i have seen?
        -if I am going to display each item as an organism, are there other examples I could use or hope to improve upon?
        -What should I name the damn thing
        -Should I use multiple pages to display different menu categories?
        -What other functions should I have??

    Thoughts
        -at first glance, project seems fairly easy, even working wihtin a new language.  Using the mini project I should be able to get a general idea of ideal layout and page operation. styling the page around the wireframe will be somewhat challenging but the trial and error will good for practicing breaking my code.  
        -BEFORE GOOGLING GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ON THE PAGE.
        -Re work through tutorial and go in with fresh mind.
